.. admonition:: Description

A simple tutorial introducing the basics of Plone development.

.. contents:: :local:

This tutorial uses hello world style examples to introduce common activities in Plone development. It covers a basic form, a custom content-type, and a dynamic view. 

It also has detailed sections on building a development environment, installing Plone, and creating an add-on package for your development code. 

The tutorial was created on a unix-like system, but should apply in general to any platform. The examples require you to work with the filesystem and command-line prompt. 

There are many ways to install Plone. 

    In the examples, we build a new version of Python 2.7 and create a virtual_env using the new Python. We then install Plone within the virtual_env using ZopeSkel 2.21.2. 
    
    This can be a lot of work, just to try some hello world examples in Plone. 
    
    You don't have to do it this way. You can create a similar environment using the `Plone 4 installers <http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/4.2>`_. The examples should all work with little or no adjustment. 
    
    There are benefits to managing your own Python development environment. The choice is up to you.

This tutorial is only an introduction to Plone development. Other areas of the developer manual have more detailed information. We link to some of those areas in the examples below.
